This project is a web application developed in .NET Core (C#) for managing an online patisserie shop. The system allows users to browse all available products, search products by category or flavour, view details for a chosen product, and purchase items. After completing a purchase, users can leave reviews on the products they have bought, enabling feedback and interaction. The project follows the MVC architecture, using Entity Framework Core, ASP.NET Core Identity for user authentication and authorization, and Razor views for the frontend.
